### Overview

<p className="mt-4">
  Once you have successfully set up your environment, the next step is to log in
  as a super admin from the login page. Upon logging in, you will be redirected
  to the App Dashboard where you should set up some essential settings to make
  your application workable.
</p>

<p className="my-4">
  The necessary settings that you should configure include authentication
  settings, global settings, SMTP settings, and payment settings. Those
  necessary settings you should do, these are mentioned below.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  Overall, setting up these necessary settings will ensure that your application
  runs smoothly and that users have a seamless experience when using your
  application. By taking the time to configure these settings, you can ensure
  that your application is secure, user-friendly, and fully functional.
</p>

### Global Settings

import { Card, Cards } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<p className="my-4">
  Global settings are important settings that contain global information for
  your application, such as the app name, email, URL, and timezone. But the most
  will be OpenAI API key, AWS key, AWS secret.

<div className="mt-4">
  > **Note:** These are the most important settings for your application. If you
  don't set up these are correctly then the AI features will not work for your
  application. I have mentioned these below.
  <ul className="list-disc pl-10">

#### OpenAI API Key

<p className="my-4">
  OpenAI key is required for your application to create content using OpenAI's
  powerful language model. Without it, your application will not be able to
  generate content, which could severely limit its functionality. Therefore, it
  is essential to ensure that the OpenAI API key is properly configured and that
  your application can access it without any issues. By setting this key, you
  can unlock the full potential of OpenAI's language model and provide your
  users with powerful content generation capabilities. So how can you get this
  credential, which is described down below.
</p>

<ul className="list-decimal pl-10">
