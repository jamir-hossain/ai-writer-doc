### Overview

<p className="mt-4">
  Once you have successfully set up your environment, the next step is to log in
  as a super admin from the login page. Upon logging in, you will be redirected
  to the App Dashboard where you should set up some essential settings to make
  your application workable.
</p>

<p className="my-4">
  The necessary settings that you should configure include authentication
  settings, global settings, SMTP settings, and payment settings. Those
  necessary settings you should do, these are mentioned below.
</p>

<p className="mb-6">
  Overall, setting up these necessary settings will ensure that your application
  runs smoothly and that users have a seamless experience when using your
  application. By taking the time to configure these settings, you can ensure
  that your application is secure, user-friendly, and fully functional.
</p>

### Global Settings

<p className="my-4">
  Global settings are important settings that contain global information for
  your application, such as the app name, email, URL, and timezone. But the most
  will be OpenAI API key, AWS key, AWS secret.

  application. I have mentioned these below.
