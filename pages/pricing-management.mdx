  Creating subscription plans is an essential step in setting up your
  application, as it enables you to offer different pricing options to your
  users based on their needs. To create subscription plans, you can navigate to
  the Pricing Management page in your application and click on the `Create New
  Subscription` button. This will take you to the New Subscription creation
  page, where you can specify details such as the plan name, description, price,
  and duration. You can also customize other settings such as the trial period,
  recurring billing, and available features for each subscription plan. By
  creating multiple subscription plans, you can cater to the needs of different
  user groups and provide a range of pricing options that suit their budgets and
  requirements. Proper subscription management can help you retain customers,
  increase revenue, and grow your business. Therefore, it is essential to ensure
  that your subscription plans are created accurately and maintained
  effectively.

### Create New Subscription

<p className="my-4">
  To create a new subscription plan, you need to provide the required details
  and the Payment Gateway Plan ID. This ID connects the subscription plan to the
  payment gateway. You must first create a plan in your payment gateway account
  and copy the plan ID and paste it into your application's subscription plan
  creation page. Through this process, your plan will connect with your payment
  gateway plan. Accuracy is vital when entering the plan ID, and any errors
  could result in payment issues. Creating subscription plans with accurate
  details ensures a smooth payment experience for users.
