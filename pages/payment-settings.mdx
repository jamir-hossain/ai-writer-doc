  The payment settings in your application are crucial as they determine how
  users can pay for goods or services. In your application, you will find three
  payment gateway options, including Stripe, Paypal, Razorpay, Mollie and
  PayStack. From this section, you can activate or deactivate these payment
  gateways based on your preferences. If you choose to activate them, you will
  need to provide certain payment information such as api key, api secret and

  By configuring these settings properly, you can provide a seamless payment
  experience for your users and boost customer satisfaction.
