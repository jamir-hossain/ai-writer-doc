### Global Settings

<p className="my-4">
  Global settings are important settings that contain global information for
  your application, such as the app name, email, URL, and timezone. One of the
  most crucial settings is to set the OpenAI API key. This key is required for
  your application to create content using OpenAI's powerful language model.
  Without it, your application will not be able to generate content, which could
  severely limit its functionality. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that
  the OpenAI API key is properly configured and that your application can access
  it without any issues. By setting this key, you can unlock the full potential
  of OpenAI's language model and provide your users with powerful content
  generation capabilities.

### Auth Settings

<p className="my-4">
  In the application's authentication settings, you will find two options for
  signing up with Google and Facebook. From this section, you can activate or
  deactivate these sign-up systems according to your preferences. If you decide
  to activate them, you will need to provide certain details such as client Id,
  client secret, and redirect URL. These details are essential for setting up
  authentication with these platforms, and you must ensure that they are
  provided accurately. Once you have provided these details, your users will be
  able to sign up and log in to your application using their Google or Facebook
  accounts. This can help to streamline the authentication process and provide a
  convenient sign-up option for users who prefer to use their social media
  accounts. However, if you decide to deactivate these sign-up systems, your
  users will only be able to create accounts through other methods provided by
  your application.

### SMTP Settings

<p className="my-4">
  SMTP settings are important for any Laravel application that requires sending
  out email notifications or alerts. In your Laravel app, you can configure SMTP
  settings to ensure that emails are delivered successfully. This involves
  setting up email templates, SMTP settings, and an email service provider such
  as Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook. By providing accurate SMTP settings, your
  application can authenticate and establish a secure connection with the email
  service provider, making it easier to send out emails reliably. Additionally,
  you can configure other settings such as email encryption, port numbers, and
  message throttling to further customize your SMTP settings according to your
  needs. Overall, proper SMTP settings can help ensure that your application's
  emails are delivered successfully and enhance the user experience.

### Payment Settings

<p className="mt-6 mb-3">
  The payment settings in your application are crucial as they determine how
  users can pay for goods or services. In your application, you will find three
  payment gateway options, including Stripe, Paddle, and Razorpay. From this
  section, you can activate or deactivate these payment gateways based on your
  preferences. If you choose to activate them, you will need to provide certain
  payment information such as api key, api secret and other relevant payment
  details. By providing accurate payment information, you can ensure that users
  can pay for goods or services conveniently and securely. By configuring these
  settings properly, you can provide a seamless payment experience for your
  users and boost customer satisfaction.
