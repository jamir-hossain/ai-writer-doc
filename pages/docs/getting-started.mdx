  Before deploying your Laravel application, it is important to ensure that the
  server meets the necessary requirements. This includes installing PHP 7.4 or
  later, Composer, Node.js, and a database such as MySQL. PHP is required to run
  Laravel, while Composer is used to install the application's dependencies.
  Node.js is necessary for installing dependencies of front-end frameworks.
  Finally, a database such as MySQL is needed to store and manage your
  application's data. By making sure that these tools are installed on the
  server, you can ensure that your Laravel application will run smoothly and
  efficiently. After complete deployment, you need to follow bellow
