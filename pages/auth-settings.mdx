### Overview

<p className="my-4">
  In the application's authentication settings, you will find two options for
  signing up with Google and Facebook. From this section, you can activate or
  deactivate these sign-up systems according to your preferences. If you decide
  to activate them, you will need to provide certain details such as client Id,
  client secret, and redirect URL. These details are essential for setting up
  authentication with these platforms, and you must ensure that they are
  provided accurately. Once you have provided these details, your users will be
  able to sign up and log in to your application using their Google or Facebook
  accounts. This can help to streamline the authentication process and provide a
  convenient sign-up option for users who prefer to use their social media
  accounts. However, if you decide to deactivate these sign-up systems, your
  users will only be able to create accounts through other methods provided by
  your application.
